# Need Help?

OCCA is still heavily in development, so lots of questions can come up from first-time programmers that might not be covered in these docs

There is no better feedback than that of a first-time user, so feel free to reach out!

?> Drop by our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/libocca/shared_invite/zt-4jcnu451-qPpPWUzhm7YQKY_HMhIsIw) to chat or feel free to open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues) to start a conversation!
