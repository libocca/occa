# Concurrency Support Examples

This temporary directory contains examples demonstrating concurrent (host-side) usage of the OCCA runtime API and other programming models for heterogeneous platforms. Examples in the `occa` directory contain use cases needed by downstream project which are not yet supported or functional. Examples other directories contain fully functional use cases which are implemented directly in the programming models used to implement various OCCA modes (backends).
