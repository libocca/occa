## Performance, Portability, Transparency

OCCA is an open source, portable, and vendor neutral framework for parallel programming on heterogeneous platforms. The OCCA API provides unified models for concepts—such as a device, memory, or kernel—which are common to other programming models. The OCCA Kernel Language (OKL) enables the creation of portable device kernels using a directive-based extension to the C-language. 

Mission critical computational science and engineering applications from the public and private sectors rely on OCCA. Notable users include the U.S. Department of Energy and Royal Dutch Shell.

**Key Features**

- **Muitiple backends**&mdash; including CUDA, HIP, Data Parallel C++, OpenCL, OpenMP, and Metal
- **JIT compilation** and caching of kernels
- C, C++, and ***Fortran*** language support
- **Interoperability** with backend API and kernels
- **Transparency**&mdash;easy to understand how your code is mapped to each platform


## Requirements

### Minimum

- [CMake] v3.17 or newer
- C++17 compiler
- C11 compiler

### Optional

 - Fortan 90 compiler
 - CUDA 9 or later
 - HIP 3.5 or later
 - SYCL 2020 or later
 - OpenCL 2.0 or later
 - OpenMP 4.0 or later


A detailed list of tested platforms can be found in the [installation guide](INSTALL.md).


## Build, Test, Install

OCCA uses the [CMake] build system. Checkout the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) for a comprehensive overview of all build settings and instructions for building on [Windows](INSTALL.md#windows) or [Mac OS](INSTALL.md#mac-os). 

### Linux 

For convenience, the shell script `configure-cmake.sh` has been provided to drive the CMake build. Compilers, flags, and other build parameters can be adjusted there. By default, this script uses `./build` and `./install` for the build and install directories.

The following demonstrates a typical sequence of shell commands to build, test, and install occa:
```shell
$ ./configure.sh
$ cmake --build build --parallel <number-of-threads>
$ ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
$ cmake --install build --prefix install
```

If dependencies are installed in a non-standard location, set the corresponding [environment variable](INSTALL.md#dependency-paths) to this path. 


## Use

### Building an OCCA application

For convenience, OCCA provides CMake package files which are configured during installation. These package files define an imported target, `OCCA::libocca`, and look for all required dependencies.

For example, the CMakeLists.txt of downstream projects using OCCA would include
```cmake
find_package(occa REQUIRED)

add_executable(downstream-app ...)
target_link_libraries(<downstream-app> PRIVATE OCCA::libocca)

add_library(downstream-lib ...)
target_link_libraries(<downstream-lib> PUBLIC OCCA::libocca)
```
In the case of a downstream library, linking OCCA using the  `PUBLIC` specifier ensures that CMake will forward OCCA's dependencies and compiler flags automatically.

### Environment

During installation, the [Env Modules](Env_Modules) file `<install-prefix>/modulefiles/occa` is generated. When this module is loaded, paths to the installed `bin`, `lib`, and `include` directories are appended to environment variables such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
